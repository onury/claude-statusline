# claude-statusline - Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).


## 2.2.1 (2026-07-04)

### Fixed
- **`--responsive` no longer drops sections that actually fit.** The width estimate assumed *every* section was `--width` columns wide, but the `branch`/`model`/`cost` columns are sized to their content (often far narrower). On a line with those sections, the estimate ran well over the true width and dropped the rightmost section (e.g. `model`) even with plenty of room to spare. It now sums each section's real display width — bar sections at `--width`, label/value columns at their content width — so sections drop only when the line genuinely overflows.

### Changed
- The `cost` section's label is now **`S.Cost`** (session cost) instead of `Cost`, to make explicit that it's this session's spend, not a credit balance.


## 2.2.0 (2026-07-04)

### Added
- **`cost` section** (alias `credit`) — shows this session's estimated spend (`.cost.total_cost_usd`) as a plain `S.Cost $0.41` amount: the `S.Cost` label (session cost) on line 1 and the dollar value on line 2 in amber (in compact, `S.Cost $0.41` inline). No bar and no `%` — Claude Code exposes no usage-credit balance to the status line, so there's nothing to measure against; this is the closest signal for pay-as-you-go spend once a rate limit is hit. **Off by default.**
- **`/sl cost on|off`** toggle in `sl-config.sh` (`credit` accepted as an alias).

No change to existing sections' output.


## 2.1.0 (2026-06-29)

### Added
- **`sl-config.sh`** — a bundled POSIX-sh helper that powers the `/sl` slash command. It maps a request (`compact`/`expanded`, a section comma-list, `model on|off`, `branch on|off`, `time …`, `width N`, `responsive on|off`, a literal `--flag` passthrough, `help`, or empty) to the right `--flag` and edits **only** that flag on your `statusLine.command` in `settings.json`, in place (symlink-safe).

### Changed
- The **`/sl` command** is now a one-line wrapper that runs `sl-config.sh` and relays its output. Previously the full request→flag mapping was baked into the command prompt and worked out by the model on every call — moving it into the script does the **same edits for ~10× fewer tokens and near-instantly**, with no behavior change.
- `/sl` now installs **two files** (`commands/sl.md` + `sl-config.sh`).

No change to the status line renderer's output.


## 2.0.0 (2026-06-26)

### Removed
- The **`--branch` and `--model` flags** — sections are now controlled solely by `--sections`, rendered **in the order given**.

### Changed
- The token section is **renamed to `context`** (`tokens` still works as a legacy alias).
- **New default:** `--sections context,5hr,week,branch`.
- **Narrow widths (expanded):** when a section's `%` no longer fits, it's dropped (the bar still shows the level). For `5hr`/`Week` the label stays pinned left and the time value (`-02:35`, `-6days`) right-aligns into the freed space; `context` stays left-aligned.
- **Compact layout:** no bar-width padding — each field fits its content.

Migrate: `--branch true` → add `branch` to `--sections` (now on by default); `--model true` → add `model` to `--sections`.


## 1.6.0 (2026-06-26)

### Added
- **`/sl` slash command** — an optional Claude Code command for changing the status line **from inside a session**, no hand-editing of `settings.json`. It edits only the flag you name, preserves the rest, and persists the change (symlink-safe).


## 1.5.0 (2026-06-26)

### Added
- **`--layout expanded|compact`** — `compact` collapses the status line to a **single line**: drops the line-2 bars, and the `branch`/`model` sections show their value (e.g. `main`, `Opus 4.8 (1M)`) in place of the label. `expanded` (default) is the usual two-line view.
- **Colored percentages** — each `%` takes its bar's leading-edge gradient hue (green→red), dimmed a touch so it reads as a value.
- **Highlighted time values** — the 5hr/week reset time/date (`@21:12`, `@Jun03`) get a medium brightness tier, between the dim label and the bright `%`.

### Changed
- Default `--width` is now **16** (was 15), and the weekly reset date is space-free (`@Jun03`) so it never clips, even at 100%.


## 1.4.0 (2026-06-26)

### Added
- **`branch` section** — shows the active git branch, placed **before** the model column and colored blue; shows the short commit hash when detached, and is skipped when the workspace isn't a git repo. On by default (`--branch true`).

### Changed
- The `branch`/`model` columns now **fit their content** instead of padding out to the bar width; the other sections keep their fixed `--width`.


## 1.3.0 (2026-06-20)

### Added
- Initial public release. A drop-in status line for Claude Code: **per-cell green→red gradient bars** for context, 5-hour, and weekly rate limits (brightness shows fill); **`--time reset|remaining|elapsed`** window clocks; **awaiting `•••` placeholders** before the first API response; an optional `model` section; responsive section-dropping to fit the terminal; and always-preserved pipe alignment. Pure `sh` + `jq` + `awk`, 24-bit truecolor (macOS / Linux).
